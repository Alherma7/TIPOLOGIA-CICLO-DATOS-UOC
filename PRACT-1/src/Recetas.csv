https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/238588/quick-and-easy-paella/;Spanish;Quick and Easy Paella;Updated on June 2, 2025;By John Mitzewich John;Consider this paella recipe a gateway and the first step to a serious, lifelong love of this classic Spanish dish. I've used a minimum number of ingredients and steps to focus on technique. After learning the method, you'll ideally use a wider variety of ingredients, like clams, mussels, squid, and chicken, which will make your rice that much more interesting. Garnish with extra virgin olive oil, freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley, and lemon wedges.;4.8;129 Reviews;"Prep Time:

They are enjoyed as a tapa all over Spain. This is simply my latest recipe for them. They are fiercely textured, fiercely flavored, fiercely presented, and fiercely enjoyed.
