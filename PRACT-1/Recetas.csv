I first had it when a friend brought it to our final dress rehearsal and begged her for the recipe! It is especially striking when the fruits and berries are in season. Personally, I like to add coconut for the crunch, but it's NOT sweetened coconut – it's unsweetened, in big flakes, and I get it from the fruit and nut guy at our commissary. It's a real crowd pleaser and the best thing about it is you can make it a day ahead. Just allow the meringue to fully cool and cover lightly with plastic wrap.

I serve it with white rice and potato sticks! Some like to add chile peppers to make this a bit spicier but I prefer a salty, more savory stew. You can also add more broth or coconut milk to adjust the consistency. It should be thick but creamy. It should not be gummy. The use of table cream or creme de leite is not always traditional, but I love it!;NA;NA;"Prep Time:

The traditional method for the grated potatoes was to get a cookie sheet and drive nails through it to create a giant potato grater. After grating (always scraped a knuckle or two), we'd place the mushy potato into a towel and twist it until all the juice was gone. Ouch! Sometimes the towel would rip, shooting the mix everywhere.

The Cuban-style marinade for this Cuban-style mojo shrimp recipe is full of citrus flavors with a few surprises. Typically, mojo means a flavor based on Seville oranges, and these sour oranges can be hard to find. But some extra lime, grapefruit, and vinegar stand in for any brightness from the missing Seville oranges. The red pepper flakes add a little zing, so if you like spicy foods, feel free to add more to your taste.

Half of the dough yields a sugared butter cookie, while the other half is unsugared and topped with a pecan half. This recipe can be easily halved for a smaller yield, but believe me, the cookies disappear quickly. You won't regret making an entire batch because no one can stop eating them.

As for the sauce, less is more. I like to add small dollops all over the surface to ensure even distribution and maximum crispiness. If you’re craving some spice, my favorite topping to hit this with as soon as it comes out of the oven is a hefty drizzle of hot honey.";5.0;1 Review;"Prep Time:

My take on traditional Norwegian kålruletter. My girlfriend likes the way I make them. I use a little less potato starch and throw some caraway seeds and rice in the filling, leaving a more meaty texture and a bit more flavor, in my opinion.

It is easier to make in large batches since the prep is time-consuming. I double or triple the recipe and bake them in an electric roasting pan. I freeze any extras, and when they come out of the freezer, they taste even better because the cabbage has becomes more tender. My grandma made these with various combinations of beef, veal, and pork and constantly experimented to get them right. I typed this up based on her notes, but she cooked as I do. Experiment with the meats and the flavors until you get something you like. I like to mix up the type of spices I use; sometimes, they are plain with just the marjoram, and sometimes, I use Italian seasoning.";4.1;14 Reviews;"Prep Time:

The money wasn't great, so I'd get a beef pirozhki from a sketchy deli in the back of a big-city corner store for lunch. It only cost two bucks, delivered a ridiculously high number of calories, and even though I knew it wasn't the healthiest thing to eat, I grew to love the taste.

They're traditionally served with butter and a sprinkle of sugar, but I also enjoy them with some smoked salmon, sour cream, and fresh dill.

Lutefisk is cod that was historically dried for storage through the winter. Then when it was time to use it, it was soaked in a mixture of lye and water, which rehydrated and softened it. The texture is like Jell-O and will fall apart easily so it needs to be handled carefully. It is an odd food for sure, fish-flavored Jell-O, so don't be too critical.
